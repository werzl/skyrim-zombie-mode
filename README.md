## Overview
The minigame is triggered by starting a quest in /Falkreath/Dawnstar/Morthal/etc...

Quest is to protect the town from a horde of Draugr.

They come in waves, and get stronger with each wave (Draugr -> Draugr Deathlord).

Kill certain amount before the wave ends.

Currency is gold, which can be used to buy NPCs to fight for you, or scrolls that allow you to place traps.

Talk to the Steward at the end of each wave, to start the next one.

## Win Condition

## Loss Condition
Place the Yarl in the middle of town, directing the Guards. If his health falls below a certain amount, the minigame ends.
